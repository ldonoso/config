Add the following line to the configuration file: source ~/varios/vimfiles/_vimrc
Installing vundle:
     linux: git clone https://github.com/gmarik/vundle.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim

## How should I set up tag files for a multi-level directory hierarchy?
A local tag file in each directory containing only the tags for source files in that directory, in addition to one single global tag file present in the root directory of your hierarchy, containing all non-static tags present in all source files in the hierarchy.

The advantages of this approach are many. All lookups of tag located in the currect directory are fast and the local tag file can be quickly and easily regenerated in one second or less. A lookup of a (necessarily non-static) tag found in another directory fails a lookup in the local tag file, but is found in the global tag file, which satisfies all cross-directory lookups. The global tag file can be automatically regenerated periodically with a cron job.

### Implementation
Within each of the leaf nodes (i.e. hdrs, lib, src, test) build a tag file. This can be easily be done for the whole hierarchy by making a shell script: 
    #!/bin/sh
    cd $1
    ctags -f .tags *

Now execute the following command:
    find * -type d -exec ~/varios/vimfiles/dirtags.sh {} \;

Build the global tag file, --file-scope=no indicates tags scoped only for a single file (static) shouldn't be included in the output: 
    cd ~/project
    ctags -f .tags --file-scope=no -R

Configure vim to read the local tag file first, then consult the global tag file when not found in the local tag file:
    :set tags=./tags,tags,~/project/tags 

The following Vim key mapping is quite useful to rebuild the tag file in the directory of the current source file:
    :nmap ,t :!(cd %:p:h;ctags -f .tags *)&
